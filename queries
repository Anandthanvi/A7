1. We have added the preferred language column in the user's table so that system can take default language for the email templates and for User Interface from that preferred language.
2. When saving customer details in database, we need to save the cotio_code_id, user_id, firstname, lastname in shipping_details table. This is because we needed a relation between user and cotio code at the time of email notification.
3. Process status column is added to cotio_code table instead of cotio_product table.
4. In order's table, we have changed the cotio_product_id to cotio_code_id. It is needed for donation because cotio code can be donated before the handler inputs the details and make a cotio_product.
5. We need to discuss transaction and invoice process. We have made tables but it is required to be discussed.
